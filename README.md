# ‚ôªÔ∏è Template Document (v0.1)
Hey everyone! After a long time, I've managed to publish a new template site for free and for everybody (even for those, who have a small experience in frontend development. This easy, minimalistic, lightweight and responsive site was made in a few hours. I have fixed some issues, added more variables to use and also included 9 color palettes, so everyone can choose their unique look. The setup of this site is ready in under 5 minutes! If you want to change the color pallet for your site, you have a small comment in the CSS file explaining what to do (it's just about uncommenting 4 lines, nothing more...).

# üîß What do you get
* Main site with example code and pre-built embed, content and footer 
* Lightweight and easy-to-use CSS file
* HTML file built on the newest Bootstrap 5
* 9 color palettes for the unique branding

# ‚ùî Demo version
You can access my template on [this site](https://showcase.adam-klement.cz) (with the default blue theme version).
